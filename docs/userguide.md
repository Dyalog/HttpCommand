## Shortcut or Instance? 
There are two ways to use `HttpCommand`. 

* Use one of its shortcut methods (`Get`, `Do`, `GetJSON`) to execute a single HTTP request and examine the response from the host. When you use a shortcut method, `HttpCommand` will create a new, local, instance of itself and then use the instance's `Run` method to send the request and receive the response, then exit thereby destroying the local instance. This is generally fine when your requests are independent of one another and do not require any state to be maintained across requests.</br>
* Create an instance of `HttpCommand` using `‚éïNEW` or the `New` shared method, set whatever parameters are necessary, execute the `Run` method, and examine the response from the host. Creating an instance of `HttpCommand` and using the `Run` method to send the request and receive the response will persist the instance such that state information like connection information and HTTP cookies will be retained across requests.

## `HttpCommand`'s Result
The result of the `Run` method is a namespace containing information related to the result of the request. The display format (`‚éïDF`) of the result presents some useful information.

```
      ‚ä¢r ‚Üê HttpCommand.Get 'https://www.dyalog.com'
[rc: 0 | msg:  | HTTP Status: 200 "OK" | ‚ç¥Data: 20571]
```
* `r` is the namespace result
* `r.rc` is `HttpCommand`'s numeric return code. 0 means `HttpCommand` was able to create and send the request to the host, send it, and receive and process the response.</br>If `rc` is less than 0, it means there was some problem either composing/sending the request or processing the response.</br>If `rc` is greater than 0, it is the Conga return code and generally means that Conga encountered something unexpected. More information about `rc` can be found [here](msgs.md). 
* `r.msg` is a (hopefully meaningful) message describing whatever the issue was if `r.rc` is non-zero.
* `r.HttpStatus` is the numeric HTTP status code returned by the host. A status code in the range 200-299 indicates a successful HTTP response with 200 being the most common code.
* `r.HttpMessage` is the HTTP status message returned by the host.
* `r.Data` is the payload of the response, if any, returned by the host. 
The result namespace contains other elements which are described in detail on the [Request Results](./result-request.md), [Operational Results](./result-operational.md), and [Response Results](./result-response.md) pages.

## Typical Use in Code
Typical use of `HttpCommand` might follow this pattern.

```
 resp ‚Üê HttpCommand.Get 'some-url'
:If 0 200 ‚â¢ resp.(rc HttpStatus)
    ‚çù code to handle bad request
:Else
    ‚çù code to process the response 
:EndIf
```

If you expect to make several `HttpCommand` calls, you may want to create an instance and then update the necessary settings and execute the `Run` method for each call.  This is particularly useful when the requests are made to the same host as the connection to the host will be kept open, unless the host itself closes it.

```
 hc‚ÜêHttpCommand.New 'get'  ‚çù here we expect all requests to be HTTP GET
 urls‚Üê'url1' 'url2' 'url3'

:For url :In urls ‚çù loop over the URLs
  hc.URL‚Üêurl ‚çù set this URL
  resp‚Üêhc.Run
  :If 0 200‚â°resp.(rc HttpStatus)
    ‚çù process the response
  :Else
    ‚çù process the exception/error
  :EndIf
:EndFor 
```
## Content Types
üëâ If your HTTP request has a payload and you do not specify the content type, `HttpCommand` will attempt to determine whether to use a content type of `'application/json'` or `'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'`.

This may be fine for interactively tinkering in the APL session. But when running `HttpCommand` under program control you should **explicitly specify the content type** for the payload by either setting `ContentType` or adding a `content-type` header. 

The exception to this is when using `GetJSON` which is specifically intended to interact with JSON-based web services and will use a default content type of `application/json`.
